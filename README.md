# Tweeter Project

Are you an individual who is simply bursting with whitty things to say?
Do you enjoy sharing the gift of yourself and your thoughts with strangers and friends alike?
Is your day measured by the various one-liners and catch-phrases that pop out of your brain?
Have I got an app for you!
TWEETER is what's happening now. On tweeter you can anonymously (or not) regail the wide world with your quick responses, interesting factoids, and little tidbits of wisdom. You can like and comment on the contributions of others, interacting and creating a custom tailored community to enjoy.

(Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.)
